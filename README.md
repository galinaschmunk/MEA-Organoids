Oranoids used in the experiment:
1. YH10 week 10, cultured in Sasai 3 supplemented with 10ng/ml BDNF for 9 days;
2. 28126 week 9+5, cultured in Sasai 3 supplemented with 10ng/ml BDNF for 9 days;

Experimental details:
I loaded two organoids (YH10 and 28126) after 9 days in 10ng/ml BDNF with a calcium indicator Cal520 and did a quick 15 min recording on one of the z-stacks. 
YH10 had several cells that demonstrated calcium transients resembling voltage-induced calcium changes. 
YH10 had several cells that were active. 28126 had much fewer cells that showed spontaneous calcium responses. 
Started recordings with YH10 as more promising based on the calcium imaging data. 
I stimulated with a local addition of 50 mM KCl (added 100 ul of the solution from a pipette in close proximity to the organoid to a 3 ml bath). This system has its limitations, of course, but it was the quick and dirty test. 
Data files are for before the KCl addition, after 5 mins, and after 7 mins. 
The spiking frequency goes up (5 mins), and then it goes down (7 mins).
